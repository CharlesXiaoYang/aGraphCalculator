# aGraphCalculator 🧮

**- Inspiration 💡** <br>
We wanted to create something that is more than a one time work, but a productive tool that we can put to use in the future.

**- What is does ❓** <br>
This beta version of the graph calculator graphs a single expression over the domain -1000 ~ 1000. It currently supports multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, exponentiation, logarithm, trigonometric functions, etc. The best feature we think it has is that it allows users to download the image.

**- How we built it 💻** <br>
We started off by creating the template with Bootstrap, pure HTML. The graphing part was sponsored by plotly.js. Before presenting the final graph, our backend, constructed with flask, will parse the user input into mathematical expressions and then return two lists. 

**- Challenges we ran into 🧐** <br>
We wanted to realize a dynamic version, but that requires some more advanced techniques like AJAX. It took our hours discussing it but had to give up due to insufficient time.

**- Accomplishments that we're proud of 🥳** <br>
I think one thing this graph calculator does great is that it provides downloading function.

**- What we learned 📝** <br>
We learned to use Javascript, which we understand is very popular around the world in realm of front end developing.

**- What's next for aGraphCalculator 📌** <br>
For the next steps, we wish to implement multi-function display on the same graph, support more math functions, as well as dynamically refresh the webpage.
